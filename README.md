# QueerCats

A collection of queer cat emoji. These are based on [this emoji from Google’s Noto font](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/blob/bf295c4/svg/emoji_u1f610.svg). The Noto font was released by Google under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Structure of project

- `/Flags` is where you’ll find the SVG-files used to make the emoji.

- `/PNG` contains the exported PNG-files (128px)

- `/SVG` contains exported SVG-files

- `Queer Cats.sketch` you can open this in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/).

If you don’t have access to Sketch, you can also open the source materials in any other SVG editor.

## Source materials

In the SVG folder you’ll find a file named `Queer Cat.svg` this is the main body and face of the emoji. You can use the group with an ID of “Body” as a mask for any flag (or other image you want to put on a cat’s face). The file hasn’t been optimised—all the information needed to create folders/layers in an editor should be there.

## Flags

These flags have been custom made:

- Intersex.svg
- Sapphic.svg which is based on Maya Kern’s revision of [Lydia’s design](https://medium.com/@lydiandragon/a-lesbian-flag-for-everyone-cef397b89459).

### Optimisation

All SVG files should be optimised with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and manually checked for readability.

### Attribution

The following flag SVG-files are sourced from Wikipedia:

- Ace.svg
- Agender.svg
- Aromantic.svg
- Autism.svg
- Bisexual.svg
- Demisexual.svg
- Genderfluidity.svg
- Genderqueer.svg
- Lesbian.svg
- Non-binary.svg
- Pansexual.svg
- Polyamory.svg
- Polysexuality.svg
- Pride.svg
- Transgender.svg

In due time these will be replaced with custom made once.
